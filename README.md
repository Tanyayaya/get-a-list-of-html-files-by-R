# get-a-list-of-html-files-by-R
The code in this repository can help to get a list of html files from the given url and download them into your computer. 
I used the website "http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~mdw/490M/" here. It is the course website of 
"Introduction To Computing With Data" in the University of Purdue in 2009. 
First, I got the urls of all the lecture notes by determining the related xpath from the parsed html file.
Then I downloaded all the html files by the urls and save them to a directory"purdue".
